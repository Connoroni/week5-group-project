Project description:
An app that alows users to negotiate on the price of a taxi by recieving a recommended price for their route then being able to haggle on it with drivers who can accept, reject, or offer a different price.

Problem domain:
An app that allows users to set a route from their location to a desired location with an available price. Allowing drivers to see this price, and take it or offer a different price for the user to then accept or not.

User stories:

- As a user I want to be able to negotiate on the price of a journey
- As a user I want a user friendly app with media queries
- As a user I want to be able to set a starting and end point relatively easily
- As a user, the layout clear and concise, easy to read
- As a user, I want there to be a recommended price to have a starting point.
- As a driver, I want to be able to negotiate on fares to give customers a fair price and compare this to the recommended price to see if itâ€™s worthwhile
- As a driver, I want to be able to go above the recommended price on a fare if a customer is willing
